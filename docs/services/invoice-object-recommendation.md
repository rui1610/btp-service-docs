# invoice-object-recommendation (Invoice Object Recommendation)

The Invoice Object Recommendation services provides the functionality to train a machine learning model with customer specific data that can give recommendations on G/L Accounts for incoming invoices without a purchase order reference attached. The service therefore provides a training call as described and an inference call that gives back recommendations based on a trained model to semi-automate the invoice processing in the area of accounts payable.
